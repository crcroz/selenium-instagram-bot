# Selenium Bot to Follow a Users Followers

I was unable to get InstaPy to work for me, so after a lot of struggling, I decided to make selenium work for me. It worked quite nicely. It works decently


### The Basics of How It Works

* It logs onto Instagram for you, and searchs in the seach bar for your target page. 
* After getting to the page, it clicks on the followers pop up and starts following people.
* The hard part was getting it to scroll down in the pop up window and not the main page behind it.
* Because of this it does look a little strange when you watch it work, rest assured, it does work.

### Some Recent Changes
  I have added a 90 second sleep delay after following someone. This seems like a long time but trust me in the long run it is effective.
  I have also done away with an hour sleep time after cycling through pages, and opted for a 10 minute sleep time between switching pages.
  Both of these things have kept me from gettng limited by Instagram.
* If you do the math, by following 20 people  from 3 different pages, all with 10 minute sleep delay between them.. you can follow 720 people in a day.
    That is huge.





I appreciate any feedback -peace!
