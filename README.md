# Selenium Bot to Follow a Users Followers

I was unable to get InstaPy to work for me, so after a lot of struggling, I decided to make selenium work for me. It worked quite nicely.

### The Basics of How It Works

* It logs onto Instagram for you, and searchs in the seach bar for your target page. 
* After getting to the page, it clicks on the followers pop up and starts following people.
* The hard part was getting it to scroll down in the pop up window and not the main page behind it.
* Because of this it does look a little strange when you watch it work, rest assured, it does work.


I appreciate any feedback -peace!
